# 3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
#print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')

# The octothorpe character prevents the line from being executed. This character is used to disable lines and add comments to code.
